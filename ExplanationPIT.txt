our code contains the principles of OOP and prominently it is the encapsulation and inheritance, here's why:

our code has encapsulation principle because we use a single class that has a bundle of functionalities or what we call the methods which we also use access modifier which is public and private methods.

moreover, we also use the inheritance because it is recognizable that it has code reusability it inherits the features/properties of JFrame class builds the features of a window like pag setTitle. extending existing gui components that you might need to download. 

abstraction, provides like inner workings it basically extracts from the main method and simply call these method to the main method.
